# VolTo Project

## Running the website

The project can be run by installing the dependencies with ```install.sh``` and starting the project with ```run_server.sh```

If no database is available yet (or an outdated), run the ```update_database.sh``` before running the server. This will update the database schemes.

## Development

### Creating a new project

This project was generated by intsalling python 3 and django 2.2.3, and creating an empty project with:

```django-admin startproject volver```. This should not be done again.

### Creating a new app

A project can contain multiple apps that can be reused between project.

From the project root (containing the manage.py) run

```source ./venv/Scripts/activate```
```python manage.py startapp app_name```

### Changing the database

After editing any model, run the ```make_migration.sh```
