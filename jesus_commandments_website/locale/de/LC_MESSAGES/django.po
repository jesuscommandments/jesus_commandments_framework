"Second, you are to “do good to those who hate you”, which amplifies how we "

"One of the advantages of becoming a Christian is that you now have a purpose "
"in life. Jesus called for a complete reorientation of life’s values, "
"objectives, and purpose. \n"
"Everyone needs to put bread on the table, but Jesus demands that His "
"followers “not seek what you should eat or what you should drink, nor have "
"an anxious mind.” (Luke 12:29). He then states, “For all these things the "
"nations of the world seek after” (12:30). Jesus expects us to live with a "
"different motivation and purpose, Neither survival nor comfort is to be our "
"driving impulse. \n"
"Luke introduces this command with “instead” to emphasize the opposite focus "
"from the previous verse for the believer. Jesus said, “The Father knows that "
"you need these things” (12:30). To begin with, can we trust Him? Can we rest "
"securely in the awareness that He knows our needs? \n"
"If we trust in Him, we are free to focus on His temporal and eternal "
"purposes. He commands us to “be continually or habitually pursuing His "
"kingdom.” The kingdom needs never end. \n"
"This was an introduction to the Great Commission: “Go and make disciples of "
"all nations” (Matt 28:19). Christ’s kingdom is extended by multiplying "
"individual converts and leading them to surrender to the lordship of Christ "
"on this earth. \n"
"How obedient are you today in this task? What is more important: your job, "
"home or business venture? What if His commitment to meet your needs were "
"proportional to your commitment to Him? God does not promise riches, but He "
"does promise to meet the needs of His servants who are reaching and building "
"disciples in His kingdom. \n"
"He must be King of your life as well as your Savior. His will must control "

"Teaching moments are spontaneous opportunities to illustrate an important "

"future teaching moment. \n"
"The next morning, walking back into Jerusalem, they passed this same fig "
"tree, only now “the fig tree dried up from the roots”. Shocked, Peter "
"exclaimed, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed was withered away”, "
"to which Jesus replied, “Have faith in God”. \n"
"The disciples were to have an unwavering trust in the omnipotent God who can "
"do anything that He wills to do for His own purposes. The key to an "
"unconditional faith is to have a “no-matter-what” trust and an “anything-is-"

"Either one is OK, since now your life belongs to Jesus. He makes no "

"God commands us to fear Him. Whomever you fear, you will obey. When people "

"Likewise, Christians can become presumptuous because of God’s patience, "

"is too loving and forgiving to punish them. Satan deceived Eve into "
"believing that God would do nothing if she disobeyed. When she believed the "
"lie, she became vulnerable to disobedience. \n"
"Proverbs 1:7 says: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but "

"learn – the beginning of wisdom – is that it is a painful experience to "
"disobey the Lord. The author of Hebrews wrote “My son, do not despise the "

"sins, but God will teach us not to be disobedient by certain chastisement. \n"
"If we do not fear God’s promise of chastisement, then we tend to be morally "

"take His commands seriously. This is a healthy motivation to learn what God "

"to him. Jesus took the occasion to explain the vice that turns our hearts "
"against the will and purpose of God. He gives two commands asking us to be "

"The second symptom is the anger felt when someone or something impedes tour "
