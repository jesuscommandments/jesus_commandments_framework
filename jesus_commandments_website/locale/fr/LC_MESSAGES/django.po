"Second, you are to “do good to those who hate you”, which amplifies how we "

"Third, God says, “bless those who curse you,”, which means to “speak well "

"nations of the world seek after” (12:30). Jesus expects us to live with a "
"different motivation and purpose, Neither survival nor comfort is to be our "

"Luke introduces this command with “instead” to emphasize the opposite focus "
"from the previous verse for the believer. Jesus said, “The Father knows that "
"you need these things” (12:30). To begin with, can we trust Him? Can we rest "
"securely in the awareness that He knows our needs? \n"
"If we trust in Him, we are free to focus on His temporal and eternal "
"purposes. He commands us to “be continually or habitually pursuing His "
"kingdom.” The kingdom needs never end. \n"
"This was an introduction to the Great Commission: “Go and make disciples of "
"all nations” (Matt 28:19). Christ’s kingdom is extended by multiplying "
"individual converts and leading them to surrender to the lordship of Christ "
"on this earth. \n"
"How obedient are you today in this task? What is more important: your job, "
"home or business venture? What if His commitment to meet your needs were "
"proportional to your commitment to Him? God does not promise riches, but He "
"does promise to meet the needs of His servants who are reaching and building "
"disciples in His kingdom. \n"
"He must be King of your life as well as your Savior. His will must control "
"your finances, work ethic, ambitions, relationships, thoughts, and daily "
"plans. As Creator, He promises to take care of you if you are useful to His "
"kingdom now."

"fools despise wisdom and discipline.” The first lesson a believer should "
"learn – the beginning of wisdom – is that it is a painful experience to "
"disobey the Lord. The author of Hebrews wrote “My son, do not despise the "
"chastening of the Lord. Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him. For "
"whom the Lord lives He chastens. And scourges every son whom He receive. But "
"if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you "
"are illegitimate and not sons” (Heb 12:5-6). Christians are forgiven their "
"sins, but God will teach us not to be disobedient by certain chastisement. \n"
"If we do not fear God’s promise of chastisement, then we tend to be morally "
"loose. If we fear that He will do what He says in His word, then we begin to "
"take His commands seriously. This is a healthy motivation to learn what God "
"expects of us as His children – this is where wisdom begins."

"Greed enters our lives camouflaged as innocent ambition to be the best, but "
"the masquerade hides the desie to be better, wealthier, or famous – and to "
"own more or better things – than anyone in our circle of friends. This quest "
"for acceptance, respect, or honor is motivated by the belief that this is "
"the way to find fulfillment and satisfaction in life. Greed usurps the place "
"of God in our lives, yet is a poor substitute, however enticing. \n"
"When Jesus asked about a man’s inheritance, He knew the man was preoccupied "
"with getting his hands on the wealth that he thought he needed and was due "
"to him. Jesus took the occasion to explain the vice that turns our hearts "
"against the will and purpose of God. He gives two commands asking us to be "
"alert against being deceived or blind sided. We are told to “continually be "
"taking heed,” “perceiving with the mind,” and to “continually be keeping "
"ourselves on guard,” or “be aware of” traps or vices of “greed” or "
"covetousness – that is, the “constant desire or thirst to have more and "
"more.” \n"
"How do you know if greed has taken root in your heart? The first symptom is "
"discontent with whatever you have and the willingness to sacrifice "
"everything or anyone to acquire more. As soon as one item is acquired, you "
"are already thinking of something else you need. \n"
"The second symptom is the anger felt when someone or something impedes tour "
"acquisition of what you believe is necessary for your happiness. When you "
"believe you need a sizable bank account valance to feel secure about your "
"future, then whenever a preacher mentions tithing or generosity, your "
"emotions will flare up. Anger is a reaction to something or someone that "
"interferes with what you think you need for security or success. Do you "
"resent being asked for your help?"

"In the story of the rich man and Lazarus, the rich man is suffering the "
"pains of hell while pleading with Abraham to send someone to tell his five "
"brothers about the reality of hell. He was convinced that if his brothers "
"talked to someone sent back from the dead, they would believe. \n"
"But Abraham responded, “They have the Old Testament prophets, obey them” "
"This is the message of Abraham through Christ’s message to the world. If you "
"want to know the reality of eternity, then learn well the revealed word of "
"God and obey what you find there. If the rich man’s brothers would not "
"respond to the major message of God is His word, then they would not listen "
"to a messenger  even if he came from the grave. \n"
"God is amazingly gracious with His creatures, but they have to choose. If "
"they choose to live life without God, paying no attention to His word, then "
"God will let them do so in this life and then forever live without Him "
"forever. \n"
"God’s primary means of communicating His will and hope for mankind is "
"through His written word. It seems men want any other means to hear from God "
"except a revealed written word. Jesus came to declare God’s will and then "
"inspired His chosen disciples to record His will for all time. Now the only "
"way we will ever know His will is to search it out in His written word. \n"
"Second, He reveals the principle that it is not miraculous messengers or "
"signs that will convert a soul. The brothers would be shocked or awestruck "
"by the appearance of such resurrected souls with a message directly from "
"hell, but this would have no life-changing power. They might be so awestruck "
"that they would superficially worship God even more, but they would "
"ultimately fail to yield to His commands. \n"
"A follower must believe from the heart – that is, he must wants Jesus to be "
"constant companion and His authority in this life. Miracles are only "
"effective in convincing people that God is real, but they do not make a "
"person want Jesus as a permanent part his life. \n"
"Abraham in essence told the rich man, “No! This is not how God works with "
"men.” The only way to know the truth that will free the sinner from his sins "
"is through the written word of God."
