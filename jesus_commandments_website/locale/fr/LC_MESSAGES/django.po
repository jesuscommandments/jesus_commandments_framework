"<p><b>Everyone wants to be happy. But not everyone is willing to do what it takes to have a pure heart.</b></p>\n"
"<p>Blessed people are happy people. Those who are pure in heart are happy because they don’t let any evil into their hearts that would make them unhappy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Instead of having a heart that is full of impurity, unthankfulness, unbelief and evil suspicions about others, these people have pure, good, and wholesome thoughts—thoughts of thankfulness and thoughts about how they can bless others. They also have a firm, uncompromising resistance in their hearts to any thoughts of selfishness, impurity, doubt and anxiety that might try to come in.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h5>How do I become pure in heart and keep it that way?</h5>\n"
"<p>You could talk to a hundred people on the street and not find a single person who doesn’t want to be happy. But not everyone is willing to do what it takes to be pure in heart. Getting a pure heartHaving a pure heart means that you do not agree with any sinful or impure thoughts that come up in you, but rather you deny these thoughts and put them to death. It means that you are not affected or tainted by sin on ... and keeping it doesn’t happen by accident. To get a pure heart I have to put my life in order with God and people and ask for forgiveness when necessary. But purity isn’t meant to stop there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is written in Psalm 119:9, “How can a young man keep his way pure? By taking heed according to Your word.” God’s Word is the instruction manual for helping me to keep my heart pure all my life. It is not complicated to begin living a pure life. For a start, think about taking just one simple verse and obeying that, like this verse in 1 Thessalonians 5:18, “In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Think how happy I will be in one month if I am thankful in everything! How about one year later? 10 years later? Imagine the end of a long life with a pure heart that is full of thankfulness, where I’ve started out making the right choices while I’m young!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In all of life’s circumstances I have to make choices about how I react to other people, what I do with my free time, and what thoughts I allow to occupy my mind. Obeying God’s Word gives me a direction for my life and helps me make the right choices in all of the situations I meet.</p>"

If the disciples had kept the salt fresh in themselves, they would not have been arguing about who would be the greatest in Christ’s kingdom (Mark 9:34). Each was lusting to be more important that the other (Mark 10:35-45). They were losing their saltiness. Soon the responsibility of world evangelism would be placed in their hands, so peace among them was vital (Col 3:15). To maintain their team spirit and bond of unity, Paul encouraged Christians to “let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt” (Col 4:6).

"Jesus’s concept of honor, given to the humble, is far from the normal way of thinking. Some attempt to dive the appearance of humility, however false, to manipulate others. others misconstrue humility to mean criticizing yourself in public.

"<p>Employers become frustrated when they must tell their employees what to do every day, The better employee knows what needs to be done and uses his ingenuity, creativity, and skills to make the employer successful and accomplish his mission. Every employer dreams about this kind of employee. </p>\n"

"<p>The classic illustration if this principle is the Great Commission. Jesus told the Twelve and other listeners to make sure the gospel is preached to every tongue, tribe, people, and ethnic people group on earth (Matt 24:14. 28:19-20). He never said how it should be done or who should do it. He expects the profitable servant to figure it out so that He may reward the servant for his creative service. </p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The judgment seat of Christ is all about discerning who is “good” (profitable, useful) and who is “bad” (worthless, cowardly) for the kingdom’s sake (2 Cor 5:10). It is not about who has been good or bad morally but about who has contributed to expanding the kingdom around the globe without having to be told how – just because they know it is their Savior’s desire. All the rewards of heaven are promised to this kind of obedient believer.</p>"

"<p>Teaching moments are spontaneous opportunities to illustrate an important principle or truth. During a Jewish holiday, Jesus and Hid disciples had been walking back and forth from Bethany to Jerusalem. The previous morning, they walked past a fig tree that was barren of fruit. Strangely, He declared, “let no one eat fruit from you ever again”. He was setting up a future teaching moment. \n"
"The next morning, walking back into Jerusalem, they passed this same fig tree, only now “the fig tree dried up from the roots”. Shocked, Peter exclaimed, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed was withered away”, to which Jesus replied, “Have faith in God”.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The disciples were to have an unwavering trust in the omnipotent God who can do anything that He wills to do for His own purposes. The key to an unconditional faith is to have a “no-matter-what” trust and an “anything-is-possible” kind of confidence in the God who cares. through He may seem silent at time, He is always present and can change things any time He wants.</p> \n"

"\n"
"<p>The one who learns to trust God fully knows He can be trusted with however He may decide to answer to his prayers. Jesus continues in the next verse, “For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says.”</p>\n"
"\n"

At worst, the opposition can only bring about physical death, which is meaningless in comparison to Him would likely result in a death sentence from the state, but is was not to be feared, is was to be welcomed! \n"
"God commands us to fear Him. Whomever you fear, you will obey. When people fear the authorities are watching or will find about their actions, they tend to obey to the laws. \n"
"Likewise, Christians can become presumptuous because of God’s patience, deceiving themselves into believing that God will do nothing. They think He is too loving and forgiving to punish them. Satan deceived Eve into believing that God would do nothing if she disobeyed. When she believed the lie, she became vulnerable to disobedience.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Proverbs 1:7 says: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.” The first lesson a believer should learn – the beginning of wisdom – is that it is a painful experience to disobey the Lord. The author of Hebrews wrote “My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord. Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him. For whom the Lord lives He chastens. And scourges every son whom He receive. But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons” (Heb 12:5-6). Christians are forgiven their sins, but God will teach us not to be disobedient by certain chastisement. </p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If we do not fear God’s promise of chastisement, then we tend to be morally loose. If we fear that He will do what He says in His word, then we begin to take His commands seriously. This is a healthy motivation to learn what God expects of us as His children – this is where wisdom begins.</p>"

"But Abraham responded, “They have the Old Testament prophets, obey them” This is the message of Abraham through Christ’s message to the world. If you want to know the reality of eternity, then learn well the revealed word of God and obey what you find there.

"God’s primary means of communicating His will and hope for mankind is through His written word. It seems men want any other means to hear from God except a revealed written word. Jesus came to declare God’s will and then inspired His chosen disciples to record His will for all time. Now the only way we will ever know His will is to search it out in His written word.</p> \n"
"\n"
"<p>Second, He reveals the principle that it is not miraculous messengers or signs that will convert a soul. The brothers would be shocked or awestruck by the appearance of such resurrected souls with a message directly from hell, but this would have no life-changing power.
