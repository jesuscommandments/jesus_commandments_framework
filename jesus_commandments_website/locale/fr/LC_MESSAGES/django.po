"<p>Blessed people are happy people. Those who are pure in heart are happy because they don’t let any evil into their hearts that would make them unhappy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Instead of having a heart that is full of impurity, unthankfulness, unbelief and evil suspicions about others, these people have pure, good, and wholesome thoughts—thoughts of thankfulness and thoughts about how they can bless others. They also have a firm, uncompromising resistance in their hearts to any thoughts of selfishness, impurity, doubt and anxiety that might try to come in.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h5>How do I become pure in heart and keep it that way?</h5>\n"
"<p>You could talk to a hundred people on the street and not find a single person who doesn’t want to be happy. But not everyone is willing to do what it takes to be pure in heart. Getting a pure heartHaving a pure heart means that you do not agree with any sinful or impure thoughts that come up in you, but rather you deny these thoughts and put them to death. It means that you are not affected or tainted by sin on ... and keeping it doesn’t happen by accident. To get a pure heart I have to put my life in order with God and people and ask for forgiveness when necessary. But purity isn’t meant to stop there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is written in Psalm 119:9, “How can a young man keep his way pure? By taking heed according to Your word.” God’s Word is the instruction manual for helping me to keep my heart pure all my life. It is not complicated to begin living a pure life. For a start, think about taking just one simple verse and obeying that, like this verse in 1 Thessalonians 5:18, “In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Think how happy I will be in one month if I am thankful in everything! How about one year later? 10 years later? Imagine the end of a long life with a pure heart that is full of thankfulness, where I’ve started out making the right choices while I’m young!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In all of life’s circumstances I have to make choices about how I react to other people, what I do with my free time, and what thoughts I allow to occupy my mind. Obeying God’s Word gives me a direction for my life and helps me make the right choices in all of the situations I meet.</p>"

Soon the responsibility of world evangelism would be placed in their hands, so peace among them was vital (Col 3:15).

"How much more encouragement do we need to pray for great things that will honor and glorify the Father through the Son?

By His response, everyone will recognize it was God’s doing.</p>\n"

"<p>Don’t be misled into thinking that this promise is all about you. it is all about God. James clarifies how to pray, saying, “You want what you don’t have, so you scheme and kill to get it. You are jealous of what others have, but you can’t get it, so you fight and wage war to take it away from them. Yet you don’t have what you want because you don’t ask God for it. And even when you ask, you don’t get it because your motives are all wrong. You want only what will give you pleasure.” (James 4:2-3) </p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Stop a moment and think of all the ways you could glorify God through your life and service. He primarily becomes evident to others by answering the prayers of His servants who want Him to be recognized as a powerful and prayer-answering God.

"<p>One of the many attributes of Jesus was His ability to be ready for whatever happened. What seemed to hurt Him most was the selfishness or disinterest of His closest friends when He knew they would e tempted and fail Him. \n"
"To the very end, Jesus was committed to training His disciples. He was telling them the secret of inner fortitude. Three times Jesus interrupted His prayers to check on His disciples who had lost interest and falls asleep. Each time, Jesus exhorted all three to “Stay awake”, or to stay alert for spiritual dangers, deceptions, or disillusionments. They were to “pray”, which expresses total dependence on the power and presence of God.</p>\n"

"<p>Jesus commanded his disciples to be fearless even when threatened with physical death for proclaiming the good news. At worst, the opposition can only bring about physical death, which is meaningless in comparison to Him would likely result in a death sentence from the state, but is was not to be feared, is was to be welcomed! \n"
"God commands us to fear Him. Whomever you fear, you will obey. When people fear the authorities are watching or will find about their actions, they tend to obey to the laws. \n"
"Likewise, Christians can become presumptuous because of God’s patience, deceiving themselves into believing that God will do nothing. They think He is too loving and forgiving to punish them. Satan deceived Eve into believing that God would do nothing if she disobeyed. When she believed the lie, she became vulnerable to disobedience.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Proverbs 1:7 says: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.” The first lesson a believer should learn – the beginning of wisdom – is that it is a painful experience to disobey the Lord. The author of Hebrews wrote “My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord. Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him. For whom the Lord lives He chastens. And scourges every son whom He receive. But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons” (Heb 12:5-6). Christians are forgiven their sins, but God will teach us not to be disobedient by certain chastisement. </p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If we do not fear God’s promise of chastisement, then we tend to be morally loose. If we fear that He will do what He says in His word, then we begin to take His commands seriously. This is a healthy motivation to learn what God expects of us as His children – this is where wisdom begins.</p>"

"<p>In the story of the rich man and Lazarus, the rich man is suffering the pains of hell while pleading with Abraham to send someone to tell his five brothers about the reality of hell. He was convinced that if his brothers talked to someone sent back from the dead, they would believe. \n"
"But Abraham responded, “They have the Old Testament prophets, obey them” This is the message of Abraham through Christ’s message to the world. If you want to know the reality of eternity, then learn well the revealed word of God and obey what you find there. If the rich man’s brothers would not respond to the major message of God is His word, then they would not listen to a messenger  even if he came from the grave.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>God is amazingly gracious with His creatures, but they have to choose. If they choose to live life without God, paying no attention to His word, then God will let them do so in this life and then forever live without Him forever. \n"
"God’s primary means of communicating His will and hope for mankind is through His written word. It seems men want any other means to hear from God except a revealed written word. Jesus came to declare God’s will and then inspired His chosen disciples to record His will for all time. Now the only way we will ever know His will is to search it out in His written word.</p> \n"
"\n"
"<p>Second, He reveals the principle that it is not miraculous messengers or signs that will convert a soul. The brothers would be shocked or awestruck by the appearance of such resurrected souls with a message directly from hell, but this would have no life-changing power. They might be so awestruck that they would superficially worship God even more, but they would ultimately fail to yield to His commands. </p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A follower must believe from the heart – that is, he must wants Jesus to be constant companion and His authority in this life. Miracles are only effective in convincing people that God is real, but they do not make a person want Jesus as a permanent part his life. \n"
"Abraham in essence told the rich man, “No! This is not how God works with men.” The only way to know the truth that will free the sinner from his sins is through the written word of God.</p>"

We are told to “continually be taking heed,” “perceiving with the mind,” and to “continually be keeping ourselves on guard,” or “be aware of” traps or vices of “greed” or covetousness – that is, the “constant desire or thirst to have more and more.” </p>\n"
