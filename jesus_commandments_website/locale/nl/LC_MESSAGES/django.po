Soon the responsibility of world evangelism would be placed in their hands, so peace among them was vital (Col 3:15).

This is not an emotional live or a friendly love. It is agape love: a decision to sacrifice for the benefit of others regardless of your feelings toward them.\n"
"Second, you are to âdo good to those who hate youâ, which amplifies how we are to love our enemies. Good means âexcellent, appropriate [or] beneficial.â\n"

"Jesusâs concept of honor, given to the humble, is far from the normal way of thinking. Some attempt to dive the appearance of humility, however false, to manipulate others. others misconstrue humility to mean criticizing yourself in public. True humility only compares itself to Jesus, and those who are truly humble recognize their personal sinfulness and hold a realistic view of their limitations and capabilities to serve others. A humble person is dedicated to making others successful, meeting their needs, and helping them become all they were designed to be. \n"

"How much more encouragement do we need to pray for great things that will honor and glorify the Father through the Son? The Father knows how to help us glorify Christ before we ask, but He waits for us to be concerned enough to ask âIt shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer. and while they are still speaking, I will hearâ (Isa 65:24. By His response, everyone will recognize it was Godâs doing. \n"
"Donât be misled into thinking that this promise is all about you. it is all about God. James clarifies how to pray, saying, âYou want what you donât have, so you scheme and kill to get it. You are jealous of what others have, but you canât get it, so you fight and wage war to take it away from them. Yet you donât have what you want because you donât ask God for it. And even when you ask, you donât get it because your motives are all wrong. You want only what will give you pleasure.â (James 4:2-3) \n"
"Stop a moment and think of all the ways you could glorify God through your life and service. He primarily becomes evident to others by answering the prayers of His servants who want Him to be recognized as a powerful and prayer-answering God. If only impossible need do you have that would most glorify God if it were answered? Pray for His gloryâs sake."

He then states, âFor all these things the nations of the world seek afterâ (12:30). Jesus expects us to live with a different motivation and purpose, Neither survival nor comfort is to be our driving impulse. \n"
"Luke introduces this command with âinsteadâ to emphasize the opposite focus from the previous verse for the believer. Jesus said, âThe Father knows that you need these thingsâ (12:30). To begin with, can we trust Him? Can we rest securely in the awareness that He knows our needs? \n"
"If we trust in Him, we are free to focus on His temporal and eternal purposes. He commands us to âbe continually or habitually pursuing His kingdom.â The kingdom needs never end. \n"
"This was an introduction to the Great Commission: âGo and make disciples of all nationsâ (Matt 28:19). Christâs kingdom is extended by multiplying individual converts and leading them to surrender to the lordship of Christ on this earth. \n"
"How obedient are you today in this task? What is more important: your job, home or business venture? What if His commitment to meet your needs were proportional to your commitment to Him? God does not promise riches, but He does promise to meet the needs of His servants who are reaching and building disciples in His kingdom. \n"

"<p>We hardly know the word loin today. A loincloth is a piece of clothing that consists only of a cotton cloth that is worn around the loins - the hips. The loins are the center of your body. The Hebrew expression \"the loins girded\" has more to do with a tunic, an undergarment. If something had to be done quickly, the tunic was tied around the loins with a leather belt. It was a starting position of someone who had to take action. In the East, both men and women wore long clothes that reached the feet. The rug was held up with the belt, so that the feet and legs had more freedom of movement. When girdling the loins, the long overcoat was taken up and put into the belt, or pulled up by the belt, when preparing to do work or travel. </p>\n"

De lendenen zijn het midden van je lichaam. De Hebreeuwse uitdrukking â de lendenen omgordâ heeft meer te maken met een tunica, een onderkleed. Als men vlug iets moest doen dan werd die tunica met een leren gordel opgebonden rond de lendenen. Het was een starthouding van iemand die in actie moest komen. In het Oosten droegen zowel mannen als vrouwen lange kleren, die tot de voeten reikten. Met de gordel werd het kleed opgehouden, zodat de voeten en benen meer bewegingsvrijheid hadden. Bij het omgorden van de lendenen werd het lange overkleed opgenomen en in de gordel gestoken, of door de gordel omhoog getrokken, als men zich voorbereidde om werk te verrichten of te reizen.</p>\n"

"Proverbs 1:7 says: âThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.â The first lesson a believer should learn â the beginning of wisdom â is that it is a painful experience to disobey the Lord. The author of Hebrews wrote âMy son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord. Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him. For whom the Lord lives He chastens. And scourges every son whom He receive. But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sonsâ (Heb 12:5-6). Christians are forgiven their sins, but God will teach us not to be disobedient by certain chastisement. \n"
"If we do not fear Godâs promise of chastisement, then we tend to be morally loose. If we fear that He will do what He says in His word, then we begin to take His commands seriously. This is a healthy motivation to learn what God expects of us as His children â this is where wisdom begins."

We are told to âcontinually be taking heed,â âperceiving with the mind,â and to âcontinually be keeping ourselves on guard,â or âbe aware ofâ traps or vices of âgreedâ or covetousness â that is, the âconstant desire or thirst to have more and more.â \n"
"How do you know if greed has taken root in your heart? The first symptom is discontent with whatever you have and the willingness to sacrifice everything or anyone to acquire more. As soon as one item is acquired, you are already thinking of something else you need. \n"
"The second symptom is the anger felt when someone or something impedes tour acquisition of what you believe is necessary for your happiness. When you believe you need a sizable bank account valance to feel secure about your future, then whenever a preacher mentions tithing or generosity, your emotions will flare up. Anger is a reaction to something or someone that interferes with what you think you need for security or success. Do you resent being asked for your help?"
